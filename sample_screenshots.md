# Description  

The *attrition_analysis.html* file will not load directly in GitHub due to the file size. As such, that file must be downloaded to view the corresponding flexdashboard in its entirety. Therefore, the following are some select snapshots of the dashboard for one to get an idea of what the end product looks like and some of its associated features and/or content.

To navigate through the dashboard, the tabs follow a left-to-right/top-to-bottom navigation scheme, starting with the "Welcome" page/tab. Additionally, some pages have quadrants, or sections, that are scrollable (up-down and/or left-right). Those sections should be indicated in their respective section header as "scrollable".

**Reminder:**  The *attrition_analysis.html* file is best viewed when maximized, especially on a monitor or screen > 15". Small screens cause the tabbed menu ribbon to overlap or hide tabs/features due to auto-adjustment(s) that is built into the dashboard.
